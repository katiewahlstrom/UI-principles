1.	What is a User Interface? 

The user interface is what gives the user the ability to interact with the program or application.  On a phone or tablet that could be the screen and the components that allow interaction.  It could be a mouse and a keyboard.  However, when speaking about computer programing it is going to be the different aspects of a program that allow the user to interact.  

2.	Explain the difference between the User Experience and the User Interface. 

UI focuses on the actual design.  It is focusing on creativity and aesthetics. 
UX focuses on design as well, but more on making the design as user friendly as possible.  

3.	What is Mock-Up?  

A bare bones design of the program before you begin to build it. 

1.	Define Low & High Fidelity 

Low fidelity are very simple, quick sketches.  They focus on the big picture instead of details.  High fidelity is more focused in on details and different aspects of the desired final program.  

2.	Outline the benefits of using one 

It would be difficult to start a project without some type of mock up.  Without having an idea of what you are making beforehand, it would be very difficult to know where to start, what steps to take, or what is missing.  It seems like it would take more time to create a program without a mock up.  Things change throughout a project, and I think that usually the mockup changes throughout the process, but it is still incredibly valuable to be able to visualize the big picture.  

4.	What is Mobile-First Design? 

Mobile first design is the concept that when designing a website or an app, you should start at the smallest screed and work your way up to the largest.  I thought this was a strange concept, as I learned it backwards from this in my design classes. However, after thinking about it and realizing that smaller screens (phones) are what is used the majority of the time, this concept really makes sense to me.  

5.	Who should be in control of the User Interface? 

The UI/UX designer would be in charge of the user interface.  

6.	Define Reusable Components. 

React components that can be used multiple times in an application, simplifying the code.
